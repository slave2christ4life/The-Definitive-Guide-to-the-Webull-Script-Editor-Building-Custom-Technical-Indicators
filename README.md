Of course. Here is a README file suitable for a GitHub repository, incorporating the new information and explaining the scope of the documentation.

# Unofficial Webull Script Editor Documentation

Welcome to the definitive guide for the Webull Script Editor. This repository provides a comprehensive, in-depth manual for developers, traders, and analysts looking to build custom technical indicators on the Webull platform.

The primary finding of this research is that **Webull Script is fundamentally based on TradingView's Pine Script language**. This guide leverages that direct connection to provide a robust and practical reference, empowering you to create powerful analytical tools.

## About This Guide

This documentation is designed to be a complete resource, taking you from first principles to advanced implementation. It includes:

  * **A Complete Function Reference:** An exhaustive list of available functions, categorized for easy navigation. Each entry includes syntax, parameters, return values, and a practical code example.
  * **A Detailed Glossary of Variables:** A thorough breakdown of all built-in variables, including price and volume data (`open`, `close`, `volume`), time variables (`time`, `bar_index`), bar state context (`barstate.*`), and symbol information (`syminfo.*`).
  * **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Practical walkthroughs for building three distinct indicators, demonstrating how to combine functions and variables to create dynamic, visual tools.
  * **Advanced Techniques & Best Practices:** Guidance on writing clean code, avoiding common pitfalls like repainting, and creating interactive visuals that enhance market analysis.

## A Note on Completeness: The Pine Script Connection

This guide was meticulously compiled from the available interface elements within the Webull Script Editor. While it is one of the most thorough resources available, it may not be exhaustive. The editor's function and variable library is subject to change, and some elements were not available in the source material.

However, any gaps can be easily filled by referencing the official documentation for Pine Script.

### Missing Functions

You may notice that certain foundational functions, such as the primary `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration functions (often referred to as `study()` in older Pine Script versions), or specific `time()` functions for session analysis, are not listed in the reference section. These are fundamental to script creation and operate identically to their Pine Script counterparts.

### Missing Variables

Similarly, the extensive list of built-in color constants (e.g., `color.red`, `color.blue`, `color.green`) is not included in the glossary. Colors can be defined using these built-in constants, dynamically with the `color.new()` function, or directly via hexadecimal strings (e.g., `#FF5733`).

### How to Extrapolate and Find Missing Information

**The key to filling any gaps is to reference the official TradingView Pine Script documentation.** Since Webull Script is a direct implementation or close dialect of Pine Script (primarily aligning with versions 4 and 5), its documentation serves as an excellent, and often definitive, resource.

For any function, variable, or concept not covered in this guide, we strongly recommend consulting these official sources:

  * **([https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/v5/index.html](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/v5/index.html))**
  * **([https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/))**

By using these resources, you can easily extrapolate the behavior of any unlisted element and continue to build with confidence.
